# Lab 4: Tilemaps

This assignment shows tilesmaps that are created from the QGIS. Four different tilemaps have been created. 

## Custom Tilemap

This is the custom map. It shows the features in different colors which aren't rendering too well on the mapbox. It shows different fonts and shows the places of interest tied to accurate colors used in map theming today. 


## Dot Tilemap

### Zoom Level Increase

![Dot Zoom 2](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/dotzoom2.png)

![Dot Zoom 3](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/dotzoom3.png)

The map here shows the dot density of the fastfood chains across the United States of America. The source of the dot denisty tilemap is from my GEOG 465 class from an assignment.


## Custom & Dot Tilemap
![Custom + Dot Tilemap](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/uw3dot.png)  

### Zoom Level Increase
![Custom + dot Zoom](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/uw3dotzoom.png)

![Custom + dot Zoom 2](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/uw3dotzoom2.png)

This map is a combined basemap of both the custom tilemap and dot density map. It shows the landmarks in relation to where the fastfood franchises are located across the United States.


## Black Lives Matter Tilemap
![Black Lives Matter Tilemap](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/blm.png)  

### Zoom Level Increase
![BLM Zoom 2](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/blmzoom2.png)

![BLM Zoom](https://github.com/T3ch12et/T3ch12et.github.io/blob/main/Lab%204/img/blm%20zoom.png)

This is the Black Lives Matter map. It shows the features that are akin to the custom map. It shows different fonts and shows the places of interest tied to the color themes of the black lives matter movement.
