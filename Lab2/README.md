I decided to compare Illinois and New York together because both of them are expansive cities, yet they both have different Twitter posts in their respective areas. I wanted to explore the differences between them to see if there were any factors that contributed to the differing amounts of Twitter posts in the area. It seems like New York has more Twitter posts than Illinois.



# Maps
Between these two places, they have slightly different geospatial patterns on the maps shown on here. Between the cities, New York is the most dense and would most likely have a high volume of Twitter posts. It's highly busy with all the traffic and buildings in the area with high amounts of jobs found there. Illinois can have busy cities, but they are often spaced out with nature found there. The places that don't have busy cities most likely have a high amount Twitter posts on the internet.
